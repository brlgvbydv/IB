## What Are Landing Pages?

A landing page, also called a squeeze page, capture page, or opt-in page, is a standalone webpage designed specifically to promote a product, service, or event. The ultimate goal of a landing page is to convert visitors into leads or customers. These pages can include forms to collect visitor information, calls-to-action (CTAs), and engaging content to encourage conversions.

### How Do Landing Pages Work?

Landing pages function by presenting visitors with a compelling offer or CTA. When a visitor interacts with the CTA (e.g., fills out a form), their information is collected and stored in your CRM. This information can then be used for targeted marketing campaigns to nurture leads and drive conversions.

**Key Benefits of Landing Pages:**

- Build relationships with potential customers.
- Capture valuable information for follow-up marketing.
- Create focused, high-converting experiences for your audience.
