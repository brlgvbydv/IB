## Why Leadpages Works

One of my favorite features of Leadpages is the **LeadBox**. A LeadBox is a pop-up form that appears when a visitor clicks a button or after theyâ€™ve been on your website for a certain amount of time. Although pop-ups might seem annoying, they are highly effective at capturing email sign-ups. Combine a LeadBox with a lead magnet, like a free e-book or resource, and youâ€™ll see incredible results.
