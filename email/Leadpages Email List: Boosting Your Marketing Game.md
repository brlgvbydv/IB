## Advanced Tools to Amplify Your Marketing

### LeadBoxes for Lead Generation

One of Leadpagesâ€™ most effective features is **LeadBoxes**. These pop-up forms can be embedded anywhere across your website, blog, or digital assets. Visitors can trigger a pop-up by clicking on a button, image, or text, allowing you to collect leads effortlessly. With advanced options like timers and exit-intent pop-ups, you can strategically capture your audience's attention before they leave your page.

### Facebook and Instagram Ad Integration

Leadpages takes digital advertising to the next level with its **Native Ad Creation** feature. This tool allows you to design and launch Facebook and Instagram ads directly from the platform. The process is fully automatedâ€”Leadpages pulls content from your landing pages, helps you edit as needed, and publishes ads that drive traffic to your pages. Plus, Leadpages automatically integrates a Facebook pixel on your pages for retargeting and analytics.

### A/B Split Testing

Wondering which version of your landing page converts better? Leadpages includes a built-in **A/B testing feature** to help you optimize your pages. Test different headlines, CTAs, or layouts to find the most effective version for boosting your conversion rates.

Leadpages integrates seamlessly with a variety of tools to create a comprehensive marketing ecosystem. For instance:

- Connect with top email marketing software to automatically add leads to your email list.
- Use Shopify integration to turn landing pages into full-fledged e-commerce platforms with buy buttons and shopping carts.
